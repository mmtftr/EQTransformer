# EQTransformer for PLAN

This repository is for the execution of the EQTransformer for the PLAN project. The new code and changes made are to enable prediction of picks on our Kandilli data. There are a couple stages to transform the data into the format that the EQTransformer can use. The overall process is as follows:

1. Organize the GCF files into station directories.
2. Convert the GCF files to MSEED format.
3. Run the EQTransformer on the MSEED files.

There is a docker image that allows the execution of the full workflow given a mounted volume of the data.

```bash
# This will first organize the GCF files into station directories, then convert the GCF files to MSEED format, and finally run the EQTransformer on the MSEED files.
docker run -v /path/to/data:/data -it ghcr.io/mmtftr/eqtransformer:latest -i /data/gcf_files
```

## Description

**EQTransformer** is an AI-based earthquake signal detector and phase (P&S) picker based on a deep neural network with an attention mechanism. It has a hierarchical architecture specifically designed for earthquake signals. **EQTransformer** has been trained on global seismic data and can perform detection and arrival time picking simultaneously and efficiently. In addition to the prediction probabilities, it can also provide estimated model uncertainties.

The **EQTransformer** python 3 package includes modules for downloading continuous seismic data, preprocessing, performing earthquake signal detection, and phase (P & S) picking using pre-trained models, building and testing new models, and performing a simple phase association.

-----------------
## Installation

**EQTransformer** supports a variety of platforms, including macOS, Windows, and Linux operating systems. Note that you will need to have Python 3.x (3.6 or 3.7) installed. The **EQTransformer** Python package can be installed using the following options:

#### Via Anaconda (recommended):

    conda create -n eqt python=3.7

    conda activate eqt

    conda install -c smousavi05 eqtransformer

##### Note: sometimes you need to keep repeating executing the last line multiple time to succeed.

#### Via PyPI:

If you already have `Obspy` installed on your machine, you can get **EQTransformer** through PyPI:

    pip install EQTransformer


#### From source:

The sources for **EQTransformer** can be downloaded from the `GitHub repo`.

##### Note: the GitHub version has been modified for Tensorflow 2.5.0

You can either clone the public repository:

    git clone git://github.com/smousavi05/EQTransformer

or (if you are working on Colab)

    pip install git+https://github.com/smousavi05/EQTransformer

Once you have a copy of the source, you can cd to **EQTransformer** directory and install it with:

    python setup.py install


If you have installed **EQTransformer** Python package before and want to upgrade to the latest version, you can use the following command:

    pip install EQTransformer -U

##### To install EqT on M1 laptop with python>=3.9 from the source (GitHub) code by changing tensorflow to tensorflow-maco in the setup.py and follow these steps:

### Important Notes:
There is not much difference between the two models (i.e. original and conservative models) regarding the network architecture (only 1 or 2 layers). The main difference comes from the training procedure and the hyperparameters used for data augmentation during the training.

***Original model*** (the one in the paper) has been optimized to minimize the false negative rate (maximize the number of detected events). This is a good choice when high false positive rates is not an issue in your application. For instance, in event location workflow most of the false positives will automatically be removed during the association, location, and - especially - relocation procedure. You can use the original model with higher threshold values (~ 0.3 for P and S and 0.5 for detection).

***Conservative Model***, on the other hand, has been optimized to minimize the false positive rate (maximum number of valid detections). This model is useful when your application can not tolerate a high false positive rate. For example, in travel time tomography or using the detected events by EqT as the templates for template matching. You should use this model with a much lower threshold levels (0.03 for P and S).

***Suggestions for Optimal Catalog Building***:
1) use the original model for detection and picking and have a cross-correlation-based event relocation at the end to clean up false positives.
2) use detected events by the conservative model as template events and then perform a complementary template-matching to detect the rest of events. See this paper (https://academic.oup.com/gji/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/gji/ggac487/6881721) as an example.

***If you feel some larger events are missed while smaller ones are detected***:
Use larger overlapping value (e.g. 0.9) for moving windows.

Note: to run the notebook examples, you may need to reinstall the jupyter on the same environment that **EQTransformer** has been installed.

It also provides a user-friendly interface to create your own EqT model and train it without dealing with coding or knowing in-depth ML.

***Siamese Earthquake Transformer*** (https://github.com/MrXiaoXiao/SiameseEarthquakeTransformer) performs a secondary template-matching-type post-processing step (by using the learned features in EqT layers as the templates and measure the similarities using a Siamese neural network instead of cross-correlation) to reduce the false-negative rate of the EqT retrieving previously missed phase picks in low SNR seismograms.

## If you think that EqT does not detect all of the events in your experiment or produces too many false positives, please let us know. We are always interested to learn more about out of distribution cases to be able to improve our models.

-------------
## Test Set

test.npy fine in the ModelsAndSampleData folder contains the trace names for the test set used in the paper.
Based on these trace names you can retrieve our test data along with their labels from STEAD. Applying your model to these test traces you can directly compare the performance of your model to those in Tables 1, 2, and 3 in the paper.
The remaining traces in the STEAD were used for the training (85 %) and validation (5 %) respectively.
